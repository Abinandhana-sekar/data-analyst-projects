# Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis

## Problem Statement
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is a crucial metric for businesses to evaluate their marketing efficiency. Understanding how much it costs to acquire new customers through different marketing channels helps businesses optimize their budgets and maximize returns. However, many businesses struggle to analyze their CAC effectively due to fragmented data and lack of analytical tools.

## Solution Need
To address this challenge, this project provides a structured data analysis approach to calculating and visualizing CAC based on marketing spend and new customers acquired. By leveraging Python and data visualization techniques, businesses can gain insights into which marketing channels yield the best results and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: Load customer acquisition dataset using Pandas.
2. **CAC Calculation**: Compute CAC as `Marketing_Spend / New_Customers`.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Histograms to understand distributions of Marketing Spend, New Customers, and CAC.
   - Bar plots to compare the number of customers acquired per marketing channel.
   - Box plots to analyze CAC distribution across different marketing channels.
4. **Deployment**:
   - A Streamlit web app is developed to allow users to upload datasets and analyze CAC interactively.

## Deployment
The project is deployed as a web application using Streamlit. You can interact with the tool here:
